# Machine Learning Coures (Coursera):
This is a repository of my coursera Machine Learning by Standford guided by Andrew NG with course assignments and lecture pdf

This is all written in matlab. The datasets are also uploaded with the excercises

Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code.

# Topic Cover
- Linear Regression (one variable and multiple variables)
